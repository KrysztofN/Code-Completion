Roasted in wrath and fire,\n         And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,\n         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\n         Old grandsire Priam seeks.'\n\n    So, proceed you.\n  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good\n     discretion.\n\n  1. Play. 'Anon he finds him,\n      Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,\n      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\n      Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,\n      Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;\n      But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\n      Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\n      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\n      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash\n      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,\n      Which was declining on the milky head\n      Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.\n      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,\n      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,\n      Did nothing.\n      But, as we often see, against some storm,\n      A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\n      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below\n      As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder\n      Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,\n      Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;\n      And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall\n      On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,\n      With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword\n      Now falls on Priam.\n      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,\n      In general synod take away her power;\n      Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\n      And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,\n      As low as to the fiends!\n\n  Pol. This is too long.\n  Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.\n    He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to\n    Hecuba.\n\n  1. Play. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'\n\n  Ham. 'The mobled queen'?\n  Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.\n\n  1. Play. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames\n      With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head\n      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,\n      About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,\n      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-\n      Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd\n      'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.\n      But if the gods themselves did see her then,\n      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\n      In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,\n      The instant burst of clamour that she made\n      (Unless things mortal move them not at all)\n      Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven\n      And passion in the gods.'\n\n  Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's\n    eyes. Prithee no more!\n  Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-\n    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you\n    hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief\n    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a\n    bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.\n  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.\n  Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his\n    desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own\n    honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in\n    your bounty. Take them in.\n  Pol. Come, sirs.\n  Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.\n                 Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First]."

What devil was't\n    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?\n    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,\n    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,\n    Or but a sickly part of one true sense\n    Could not so mope.\n    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,\n    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,\n    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax\n    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame\n    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,\n    Since frost itself as actively doth burn,\n    And reason panders will.\n  Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!\n    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,\n    And there I see such black and grained spots\n    As will not leave their tinct.\n  Ham. Nay, but to live\n    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,\n    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love\n    Over the nasty sty!\n  Queen. O, speak to me no more!"

Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence\n    And bear it to the chapel.\n  Ham. Do not believe it.\n  Ros. Believe what?\n  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be\n    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son\n    of a king?\n  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?\n  Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,\n    his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in\n    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;\n    first mouth'd, to be last Swallowed. When he needs what you have\n    glean'd, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry\n    again.\n  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.\n  Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.\n  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to\n    the King.\n  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.\n    The King is a thing-\n  Guil. A thing, my lord?\n  Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him.

Farewell.\n                            'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'\n\n    Come, I will give you way for these your letters,\n    And do't the speedier that you may direct me\n    To him from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\n\nScene VII.\nElsinore. Another room in the Castle.\n\nEnter King and Laertes.\n\n  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,\n    And You must put me in your heart for friend,\n    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,\n    That he which hath your noble father slain\n    Pursued my life.\n  Laer. It well appears. But tell me\n    Why you proceeded not against these feats\n    So crimeful and so capital in nature,\n    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,\n    You mainly were stirr'd up.\n  King. O, for two special reasons,\n    Which may to you, perhaps, seein much unsinew'd,\n    But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother\n    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-\n    My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-\n    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul\n    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,\n    I could not but by her. The other motive\n    Why to a public count I might not go\n    Is the great love the general gender bear him,\n    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,\n    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,\n    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,\n    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,\n    Would have reverted to my bow again,\n    And not where I had aim'd them.\n  Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;\n    A sister driven into desp'rate terms,\n    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,\n    Stood challenger on mount of all the age\n    For her perfections. But my revenge will come.\n  King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think\n    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull\n    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,\n    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.\n    I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,\n    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-\n\n                 Enter a Messenger with letters.\n\n    How now? What news?\n  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:\n    This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.\n  King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?\n  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.\n    They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them\n    Of him that brought them.\n  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.\n    Leave us.\n                                                 Exit Messenger.\n    [Reads]'High and Mighty,-You shall know I am set naked on your\n    kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes;\n    when I shall (first asking your pardon thereunto) recount the\n    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.\n                                                     'HAMLET.'"

Scene I.\nElsinore. A churchyard.\n\nEnter two Clowns, [with spades and pickaxes].\n\n  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully\n    seeks her own salvation?\n  Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.\n    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.\n  Clown. How can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own\n    defence?\n  Other. Why, 'tis found so.\n  Clown. It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies\n    the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act; and an\n    act hath three branches-it is to act, to do, and to perform;\n    argal, she drown'd herself wittingly.\n  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!\n  Clown. Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the\n    man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,\n    will he nill he, he goes- mark you that. But if the water come to\n    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not\n    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.\n  Other. But is this law?\n  Clown. Ay, marry, is't- crowner's quest law.\n  Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a\n    gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.\n  Clown. Why, there thou say'st! And the more pity that great folk\n    should have count'nance in this world to drown or hang themselves\n    more than their even-Christen. Come, my spade! There is no\n    ancient gentlemen but gard'ners, ditchers, and grave-makers. They\n    hold up Adam's profession.\n  Other. Was he a gentleman?\n  Clown. 'A was the first that ever bore arms.\n  Other. Why, he had none.\n  Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?\n    The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms? I'll\n    put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the\n    purpose, confess thyself-\n  Other. Go to!\n  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the\n    shipwright, or the carpenter?\n  Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand\n    tenants.\n  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well.\n    But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,\n    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the\n    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come!\n  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a\n    carpenter?\n  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.\n  Other. Marry, now I can tell!\n  Clown. To't.\n  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.\n\n                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.\n\n  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will\n    not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask'd this\n    question next, say 'a grave-maker.' The houses he makes lasts\n    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of\n    liquor.\n                                            [Exit Second Clown.]\n\n                       [Clown digs and] sings.\n\n       In youth when I did love, did love,\n         Methought it was very sweet;\n       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,\n         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet."

Let the foils be\n    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose,\n    I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my\n    shame and the odd hits.\n  Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?\n  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.\n  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.\n  Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it\n    himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.\n  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.\n  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,\n    and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes\n    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter-\n    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and\n    through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but blow\n    them to their trial-the bubbles are out,\n\n                            Enter a Lord.\n\n  Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who\n    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends to\n    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will\n    take longer time.\n  Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.\n    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided\n    I be so able as now.\n  Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.\n  Ham. In happy time.\n  Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to\n    Laertes before you fall to play.\n  Ham. She well instructs me.\n                                                    [Exit Lord.]\n  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.\n  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in\n    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not\n    think how ill all's here about my heart. But it is no matter.\n  Hor. Nay, good my lord -\n  Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as\n    would perhaps trouble a woman.\n  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their\n    repair hither and say you are not fit.\n  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in\n    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come', if it be\n    not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:\n    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he leaves,\n    what is't to leave betimes? Let be.\n\n    Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other\n              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.\n               A table and flagons of wine on it.\n\n  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.\n                    [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]\n  Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;"

Where is this sight?\n  Hor. What is it you will see?\n    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.\n  Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,\n    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell\n    That thou so many princes at a shot\n    So bloodily hast struck.\n  Ambassador. The sight is dismal;\n    And our affairs from England come too late.\n    The ears are senseless that should give us bearing\n    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd\n    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.\n    Where should We have our thanks?\n  Hor. Not from his mouth,\n    Had it th' ability of life to thank you.\n    He never gave commandment for their death.\n    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,\n    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,\n    Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies\n    High on a stage be placed to the view;\n    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world\n    How these things came about. So shall You hear\n    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;\n    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;\n    Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;\n    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook\n    Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I\n    Truly deliver.\n  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,\n    And call the noblest to the audience.\n    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.\n    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom\n    Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.\n  Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,\n    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.\n    But let this same be presently perform'd,\n    Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance\n    On plots and errors happen.\n  Fort. Let four captains\n    Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;\n    For he was likely, had he been put on,\n    To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage\n    The soldiers' music and the rites of war\n    Speak loudly for him.\n    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this\n    Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.\n    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.\n            Exeunt marching; after the which a peal of ordnance\n                                                   are shot off.\n\n\nTHE END"
